      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Software Engineering Technology student at Centennial College with
        hands-on experience in full-stack web development, databases, and
        software project management. I enjoy building modern, user-friendly
        applications and applying my skills in Java, C#, Python, SQL, and React
        to solve real problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        With professional experience at Manulife, SunLife, and RBC, I bring a
        strong foundation in automation, data analysis, and teamwork. Take a
        look around to see my projects, learn more about me, or get in touch!
      </p>
